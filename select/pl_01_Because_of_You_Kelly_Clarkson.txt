I will not make
The same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray
Too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe
Side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not
Only me
But everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long
Before you point it out
I can not cry
Because you know that's
Weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile a laugh
Everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even
Whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray
Too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe
Side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not
Only me
But everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night
In your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better
Than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the
Middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray
Too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe
Side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest
Just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let
Anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life
Because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of you
