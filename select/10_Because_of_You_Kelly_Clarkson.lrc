[00:01.51] Ooh, ooh, ooh
[00:08.01] 
[00:14.73] I will not make the same mistakes that you did
[00:20.45] I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
[00:28.50] I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
[00:35.32] I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
[01:02.32] 
[00:42.42] Because of you
[00:43.95] I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[00:49.02] Because of you
[00:50.56] I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
[00:56.10] Because of you
[00:57.39] I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
[01:03.05] Because of you, I am afraid
[01:16.55] 
[01:11.49] I lose my way
[01:14.09] And it's not too long before you point it out
[01:18.15] I cannot cry
[01:21.04] Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
[01:25.04] I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
[01:31.94] My heart can't possibly break
[01:34.64] When it wasn't even whole to start with
[01:54.14] 
[01:38.78] Because of you
[01:40.64] I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[01:45.61] Because of you
[01:47.07] I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
[01:52.42] Because of you
[01:54.02] I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
[01:59.64] Because of you
[02:02.86] I am afraid
[02:08.36] 
[02:06.47] I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep (I watched you die, in your sleep)
[02:12.99] I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me (I was too young for you to lean on me)
[02:19.78] You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain (You never saw me)
[02:26.83] And now I cry in the middle of the night
[02:30.42] For the same damn thing
[02:41.92] 
[02:37.18] Because of you
[02:38.98] I never stray too far from the sidewalk
[02:44.00] Because of you
[02:45.50] I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
[02:50.77] Because of you
[02:52.43] I try my hardest just to forget everything
[02:57.66] Because of you
[02:59.32] I don't know how to let anyone else in
[03:04.65] Because of you
[03:06.25] I'm ashamed of my life, because it's empty
[03:11.58] Because of you
[03:13.48] I am afraid
[03:18.98] 
[03:18.46] Because of you (ooh)
[03:25.38] Because of you (ooh, ooh)
