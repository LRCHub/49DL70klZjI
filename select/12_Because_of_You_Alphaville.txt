Oh, i want to know i want to go
Through that situation again, i'd like to catch
That something in your eyes it thrilled me once again
That gentle touch i can't describe
It's like a reflection of the moon on the water
Don't let it go, because of you the earth stood still
Just do it again

Burn, burn away, sacred letters, ragged backdrops
I don't care, the certainty of death,
The boring rituals of life they seem so far
I don't care for my life, i just live for your love
That is because of what you do, just do it again
Because of you the earth stood still
Just do it again
